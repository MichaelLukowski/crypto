This is a repo containing simple Diffie Hellman exchange, Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (Curve25519), and will soon include Supersingular isogeny Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange. These Keys are genererated according to the IETF specifications (RFC 2631, and RFC 7748). Once these keys are generated a symmetric cipher like AES-256 or Salsa20 can be used to encrypt messages and used between two parties.
